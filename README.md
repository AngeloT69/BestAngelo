Profile Readme
Hello!!
My name is Angelo Torres.
I am a freshman at the **University of Chicago**.
My favorite class so far is **Human Being and Citizen** in which we discuss what makes us human.
I "owned" my first computer when I was six or five. I did not have free access to it, but when I had it I used to play **Bomberman** with my sister.
Contact info: atorresinga@uchicago.edu.
My favorite programming language is **C++**. I like it because I can do competitive programming with it.
